## Project aim

This project was mainly about learning Docker, so we decided to create a web application where a user can upload photos of faces and the ml-client would return the dominant emotion.
We used the deepface module as it is well known, and the API was easy to use. 
The flow of what happens to the photo when a user uploads is as follows:
1. The photo gets saved to the database with other relative information, one important field is the "processed" field, which is initially set to False.
2. Every 30 seconds(time can be changed), the ml-client sends a request to check whether there are unprocessed images, and proccess them by adding the emotion attribute and sets "processed" as True
3. The user will be able to see the result of the emotion for the image. 

I am not sure why, but my teammates decided that we will not implement a backend for the ml-client, which is why we took a slightly weird approach of running the processing function every 30 seconds instead. 

We also decided that we are not going to upload the photos to cloud, but rather we just uploaded them locally inside a folder.

## Problem with deepface

Deepface module was all good when testing the application locally, but problems arose when I started dockerising things. 
When running the application from a ml-client docker container, there was a problem when the first photo gets uploaded and gets processed, deepface started to download very large files that were needed to analyze emotion, age, race, etc. 
This only happend for the first upload for the container, but still this meant that the user had to wait much more than 30 seconds(which is already a long time).
The solution that I found was pre-downloading these large files during the docker container creation phase by adding command to do so in the ml-client's Dockerfile.
On presentation day, another group asked me how I solved this problem and I gave them the answer above, so I saw this as a potential issue that could reoccur. 

## Getting environment variables

We need to get environment variables from .env files into the python file, in order to do so we use the following line of code:

```
os.environ.get("DB_USER")
```
