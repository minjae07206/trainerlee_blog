## Deploying to digital ocean

My team received some credits to purchase products in Digital Ocean, and I used it to purchase a App Platform.
Using the App platform is very simple, Digital Ocean will take care of most things when the user provides the Dockerhub image or the Github repository.
Environment variables can be added to Digital ocean as well.

Due to subscribtion payments in Digital ocean, the website has been taken down by myself.

## Unsolved problems

In the app-spec.yaml file I wanted to include environment variables but from the .env file, but I was not able to find a syntax that lets me to use .env file.
So I manually inputted the environment variables needed directly into Digital Ocean, but the problem was that the environment variables get overwritten into nothing when there is a deployment due to github push.
This problem still persists.

Another problem is that when a new functionality or css is pushed to the main branch and the web-app gets deployed on digital ocean, the new functionalities do not show on the website.
Only when I force re-deploy the new functions work. I assume this is a issue with cashing, and possibly could be done with deleting cash when redeployed.
However, this issue was not addressed during our project due to time constraints.
