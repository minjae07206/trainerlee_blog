## Unsolved problem

In the app-spec.yaml file I wanted to include environment variables but from the .env file, but I was not able to find a syntax that lets me to use .env file.
So I manually inputted the environment variables needed directly into Digital Ocean, but the problem was that the environment variables get overwritten into nothing when there is a deployment due to github push.
