## fs.readfileSync() not working in vercel

During trainerlee_blog development, there was a issue where readfileSync does not read markdown files correctly, returning an error that the directory does not exist.
However, the fs.readfileSync worked when I run `npm run dev` locally.
This was the original version, where `currentPostFull[0].link` contained the path from root directory of the project to the markdown file.
```
const currentPostFull: QueryResultRow[]= await fetchPostFull(id);
const markdownContent = fs.readFileSync(currentPostFull[0].link, 'utf-8');
```

## process.cwd()

On the official document of vercel, they recommend using `process.cwd()` when using `fs.readFileSync`.
Vercel has a different way of determining the root directory, so `process.cwd()` determines the root directory.
They say not to use `__dirname`.

Here is an example from vercel's official website.

```
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

export function GET(request) {
  let usersPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'users.json');
  let file = fs.readFileSync(usersPath);
  return new Response(file);
}
```

Here is my example that works both locally and in vercel, but I changed the link to only include the name of the markdown file, instead of including the path as well.
It seems that `process.cwd()` takes me to the root directory of the project. 

```
const currentPostFull: QueryResultRow[]= await fetchPostFull(id);
const markdownContent = fs.readFileSync(process.cwd() + '/public/postmdfile/' + currentPostFull[0].link, 'utf-8');
```
